alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no
pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book
thought alice without pictures or conversation
so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether
the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white
rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice
think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to
itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought
it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural
but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat
pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to
her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to
take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the
field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbithole under the hedge
in another moment down went alice after it never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again
the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well
either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to
see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was
labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it
was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it
well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll
all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it
even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely
true
down down down would the fall never come to an end i
wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud
i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let
me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for
you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to
listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes
thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude
or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was
or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to
say
presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right
through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i
think she was rather glad there was no one listening this
time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried
to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling
through the air do you think you could manage it and what
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll
never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon
began talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i
should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember
her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were
down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but
you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know
but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get
rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of
way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do
bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either
question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt
that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very
earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a
bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her
was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in
sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost
away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it
say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late
its getting she was close behind it when she turned the
corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof
there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked
and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle
wondering how she was ever to get out again
suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of
solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key
and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or
the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of
them however on the second time round she came upon a low
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key
in the lock and to her great delight it fitted
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but
she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if
my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of
very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish
i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only
know how to begin for you see so many outoftheway things
had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she
went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on
it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which
certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck
of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me
beautifully printed on it in large letters
it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little
alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look
first she said and see whether its marked poison or not
for she had read several nice little histories about children who
had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things all because they would not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your
finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had
never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked
poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or
later
however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured
to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort
of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast
turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished
it off
what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up
like a telescope
and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
size for going though the little door into that lovely garden
first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about
this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my
going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be
like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing
after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided
on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when
she got to the door she found he had forgotten the little golden
key and when she went back to the table for it she found she
could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the
legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had
tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and
cried
come theres no use in crying like that said alice to
herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute
she generally gave herself very good advice though she very
seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no
use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why
theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable
person
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on
which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants
well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger
i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep
under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i
dont care which happens
she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which
way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to
feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally
happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way
so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much
surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
english now im opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at her
feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so
far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure _i_ shant
be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be
kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the
way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of
boots every christmas
and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll
seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the
directions will look
oh dear what nonsense im talking
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in
fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one
side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get
through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to
cry again
you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great
girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in
this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all
the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool
all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to
himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she
be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit
came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please
sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very
hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday
things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in
the night let me think was i the same when i got up this
morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little
different but if im not the same the next question is who in
the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of
them
im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such
long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im
sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she
oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i
andoh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the
things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve
and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the
multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography
london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome
and romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been
changed for mabel ill try and say how doth the little
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do
im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel
after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little
house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so
many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im
mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look
up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i
like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down
here till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a
sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads
down i am so very tired of being all alone here
as she said this she looked down at her hands and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little
white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done
that she thought i must be growing small again she got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that
as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high
and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it
hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at
the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in
existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed
back to the little door but alas the little door was shut
again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child
for i never was so small as this before never and i declare
its too bad that it is
as she said these words her foot slipped and in another
moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water he first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that
case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had
been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general
conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and
behind them a railway station however she soon made out that
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high
i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about
trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i
suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer
thing to be sure however everything is queer today
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then
she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this
mouse everything is so outoftheway down here that i should
think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in
trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of
this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse
alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse
she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having
seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto a
mousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes but it said nothing
perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i
daresay its a french mouse come over with william the
conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she
began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in
her french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg
your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the
poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats
not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate
voice would you like cats if you were me
well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be
angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah
i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself
as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand
she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital
one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried alice again
for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt
certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any
more if youd rather not
we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end
of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family
always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear
the name again
i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the
subject of conversation are youare you fondofof dogs
the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is
such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you
a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly
brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and
itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi
cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you
know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds
he says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a
sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the
mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went

so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back
again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont
like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam
slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice
thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to
the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll
understand why it is i hate cats and dogs
t was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a
duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious
creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the
shore
they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the
bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their
fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and
uncomfortable
the first question of course was how to get dry again they
had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed
quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with
them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had
quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky
and would only say i am older than you and must know better
and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was
and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no
more to be said
at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among
them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill
soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large
ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes
anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad
cold if she did not get dry very soon
ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready
this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please
william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was
soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and
morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria
ugh said the lory with a shiver
i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very
politely did you speak not i said the lory hastily
i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and
morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him
and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found
it advisable
found what said the duck
found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you
know what it means
i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said
the duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is
what did the archbishop find
the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on
found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william
and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was
moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you
getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it
spoke
as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt
seem to dry me at all
in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i
move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies
speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of
half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do
either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile
some of the other birds tittered audibly
what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone
was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace

what is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted much
to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody
ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter
day i will tell you how the dodo managed it
first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the
exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party
were placed along the course here and there there was no one
two three and away but they began running when they liked
and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over however when they had been running half
an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called
out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting
and asking but who has won
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare
in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at
last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have
prizes
but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices
asked
why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
calling out in a confused way prizes prizes
alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt
water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
there was exactly one apiece all round
but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse
of course the dodo replied very gravely what else have
you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice
only a thimble said alice sadly
hand it over here said the dodo
then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo
solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
speech they all cheered
alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
looking as solemn as she could
the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise
and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back however it was over at last and they sat down again
in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more
you promised to tell me your history you know said alice
and why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half
afraid that it would be offended again
mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to
alice and sighing
it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with
wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and
she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so
that her idea of the tale was something like this
you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely
what are you thinking of
i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to
the fifth bend i thin
i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily
a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and
looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it
i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up
and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense
i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily
offended you know
the mouse only growled in reply
please come back and finish your story alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but
the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little
quicker
what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it
was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you
never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the
young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the
patience of an oyster
i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud
addressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back
and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question
said the lory
alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about
her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for
catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her
after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look
at it
this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
some of the birds hurried off at once one the old magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be
getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my
dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts
they all moved off and alice was soon left alone
i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a
melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im
sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i
wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice
began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited
in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping
that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to
finish his story
it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and
looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something
and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess
oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get me
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have
dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she
very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and
the little door had vanished completely
very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about
and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are
you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without
trying to explain the mistake it had made
he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran
how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id
better take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them
as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit
engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried
upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves
how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going
messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on
messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready
for your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see
that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went
on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking
glass there was no label this time with the words drink me
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know
something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself
whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this
bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for
really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected
before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing
against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself
thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i
cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so
much
alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and
growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in
another minute there was not even room for this and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the
other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and
as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one
foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more
whatever happens what will become of me
luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable
and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy
it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one
wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know
this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me
when i used to read fairytales i fancied that kind of thing
never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there
ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when
i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
here
but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i
am now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman
but thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like
that
oh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you
learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no
room at all for any lessonbooks
and so she went on taking first one side and then the other
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen
mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves
this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and
she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no
reason to be afraid of it
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed
hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it
say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window
that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she
ancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly
spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not
get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
of the sort
next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are
you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then
im here digging for apples yer honour
digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here
come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass
no tell me pat whats that in the window
sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum
an arm you goose  who ever saw one that size why it
fills the whole window
sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that
well its got no business there at any rate go and take it
away
there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear
whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer
honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
the air this time there were two little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumberframes there
must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for
pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i
dont want to stay in here any longer
she waited for some time without hearing anything more at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together she made out the words
wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one
bills got the otherbill fetch it here ladhere put em up
at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half
high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particular
here bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind
that loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loud
crashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go
down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wont
thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney
oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said
alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill
i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes
bill then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold
up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow
what happened to you tell us all about it
last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill
thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im
better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know
is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes
like a skyrocket
so you did old fellow said the others
we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and
alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set
dinah at you
there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to
herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any
sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they
began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a
barrowful will do to begin with
a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i
suppose
so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by
two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood
the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
i think that will be the best plan
it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut
this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
distance
and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks
very much ifif id only been the right size to do it oh
dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let
me seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what
he great question certainly was what alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else
the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in
silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice
who are you said the caterpillar
his was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice
replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at present
at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think
i must have been changed several times since then
what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly
explain yourself
i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because
im not myself you see
i dont see said the caterpillar
im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very
politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
it isnt said the caterpillar
well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but
when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you
knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll
feel it a little queer wont you
not a bit said the caterpillar
well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice
all i know is it would feel very queer to me
which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars
making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said
very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first
why said the caterpillar
here was another puzzling question and as alice could not
think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in
a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away
come back the caterpillar called after her ive something
important to say
this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back
again
keep your temper said the caterpillar
is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as
she could
no said the caterpillar
alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
again and said so you think youre changed do you
im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as
i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together
cant remember what things said the caterpillar
well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it
all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice
repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar
alice folded her hands and began you are old father william the young man said
and your hair has become very white
and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think at your age it is right
in my youth father william replied to his son
not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the
words have got altered
it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar
decidedly and there was silence for some minutes
the caterpillar was the first to speak
what size do you want to be it asked
oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied
only one doesnt like changing so often you know
i dont know said the caterpillar
alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper
are you content now said the caterpillar
well i should like to be a little larger sir if you
wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched
height to be
it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar
angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three
inches high
but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone
and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so
easily offended
youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got
down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely
remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and
the other side will make you grow shorter
one side of what the other side of what thought alice to
herself
of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had
asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as
it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a
little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her
foot
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but
she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking
rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of
delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her
what can all that green stuff be said alice and where
have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i
cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no
result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating
her violently with its wings
serpent screamed the pigeon
im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone
erpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more
subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every
way and nothing seems to suit them
i havent the least idea what youre talking about said
alice
ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive
tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but
those serpents theres no pleasing them
alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the
pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and
day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks
im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was
beginning to see its meaning
and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued
the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was
thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent
but im not a serpent i tell you said alice im aim
well what are you said the pigeon i can see youre
trying to invent something
iim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my
time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a
serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg
have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very
truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do you know
dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can say
this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent
for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of
adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and
what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a
serpent
it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im
not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt
want yours i dont like them raw
well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it
settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very
carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come
theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes
are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to
another however ive got back to my right size the next
thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be
done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an
open place with a little house in it about four feet high
whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come
upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their
wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and
wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman
because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only
she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery
with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen
alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen he fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to
the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an
invitation from the queen to play croquet the frogfootman
repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the
words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess
to play croquet
then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled
together
alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped
out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky
alice went timidly up to the door and knocked
heres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and
that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the
door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise
inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling
and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces
please then said alice how am i to get in
here might be some sense in your knocking the footman went
on without attending to her if we had the door between us for
instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let
you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but
perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so
very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might
answer questionshow am i to get in she repeated aloud
shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow
at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate
came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just
grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him
or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone
exactly as if nothing had happened
how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone
are you to get in at all said the footman thats the
first question you know
it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so
its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the
creatures argue its enough to drive one crazy
the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark with variations i shall sit here he
said on and off for days and days
but what am i to do said alice
anything you like said the footman and began whistlin
h theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately
hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in
the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of
smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a
threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was
leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup
theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to
herself as well as she could for sneezing
there was certainly too much of it in the air even the
duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause the
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear
please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first why your cat grins like that
its a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why
she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on
again
i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i
didnt know that cats could grin
they all can said the duchess and most of em do
i dont know of any that do alice said very politely
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation
you dont know much said the duchess and thats a fact
alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought
t would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work
throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby
the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up
and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious
nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very
neary carried it off
if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a
hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it
does
which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day
and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
round on its axis
talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head
alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and
seemed not to be listening so she went on again twentyfour
hours i think or is it twelve i
oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide
figures and with that she began nursing her child again
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing
howled so that alice could hardly hear the words
here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said
to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and
get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of
the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
but it just missed her
alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer
shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all
directions just like a starfish thought alice the poor
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again
so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much
as she could do to hold it
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its
undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i
dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure
to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it
behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing
grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont
grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself
the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no
doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout
than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at
all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked
into its eyes again to see if there were any tears
no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig
my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do
with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or
grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for
some while in silence
alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i
to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted
again so violently that she looked down into its face in some
alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was
neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be
quite absurd for her to carry it further
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up
she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child
but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began
thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right
way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing
the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good
natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great
many eeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at
all know whether it would like the name however it only
grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought
alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i
ought to go from here
aid alice its laid for a
great many more than three
come we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad
theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she
added aloud
do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it
said the march hare
exactly so said alice
then you should say what you mean the march hare went on
i do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what
i saythats the same thing you know
not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just
as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat
what i see
you might just as well say added the march hare that i
like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like
you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to
be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the
same thing as i sleep when i breathe
it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the
conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute
while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writingdesks which wasnt much
the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of
the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his
watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking
it every now and then and holding it to his ear
alice considered a little and then said the fourth
two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter
wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march
hare
it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied
yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter
grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then
he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it
was the best butter you know
alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the
month and doesnt tell what oclock it is
and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone
he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock now
a bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so
many teathings are put out here she asked
yes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always
teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles
then you keep moving round i suppose said alice
exctly so said the hatter as the things get used up
but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice
ventured to ask
suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted
yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady
tells us a story
im afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at
the proposal
then the dormouse shall they both cried wake up
dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once
the dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he
said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows
were saying
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder
and people began running about in all directions tumbling up
against each other however they got settled down in a minute or
two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live
flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet to make the arches
the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away
comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down
but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it
would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing
and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed
the players all played at once without waiting for turns
quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in
a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went
stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with
her head about once in a minute
lice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as
yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might
happen any minute and then thought she what would become of
me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great
wonder is that theres any one left alive
she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at
first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to
be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i
shall have somebody to talk to
how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with
alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no
use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at
least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared
and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the
game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the
cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and
no more of it appeared
i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather
a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in
particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand
youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive
for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have
croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it
saw mine coming
how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice
not at all said alice shes so extremely just then
she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so
she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while
finishing the game
the queen smiled and passed on
who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and
looking at the cats head with great curiosity
its a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me
to introduce it things alice thought to
herself
the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone
in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered
his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on
again
ou may not have lived much under the sea i havent
said aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily
and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a lobster quadrille is
wont you will you join the
dance
will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the
danceth said the gryphon i
mean what makes them so shiny
the refreshments but there seemed
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before
oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox or they would die
the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave
voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as
he said do
alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she
had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable
to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that
it signifies much she said to herself i should think it
would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
gazing up into the roof of the court
none of them attempted to
explain the paper
unfortunate little bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
trickling down his face as long as it lasted
oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told
her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a
curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its
getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she
ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
mock turtle
so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and
all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles
heavy sobs
